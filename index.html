        by Bungie Studios (now known as 343 Industries) and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The series debuted

        The Halo series is set in a science fiction universe in the 26th century, where humanity is locked in a 
        struggle for survival against a collection of alien species known as the Covenant. Players assume the role 
        of the super-soldier Master Chief, also known as John-117, who is accompanied by an artificial intelligence 
        companion called Cortana. The main objective is to defend humanity and thwart the Covenant's plans for galactic conquest.

        innovative features such as regenerating shields, dual-wielding weapons, and a variety of alien and human weaponry.
